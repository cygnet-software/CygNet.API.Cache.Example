# CygNet.API.Cache.Example
Sample project to show how to use the CygNet.API.Cache API

This sample shows how to use the cache in two ways:

1. Immediate data retrieval
2. Subscription for changes

You will need to update the build path to your CygNet\BIN folder, or where ever you have staged all the CygNet.API files.
